OpenWRT for Qemu on x86

== Quick Start

	1) git clone http://github.com/cozybit/openwrt_11s
	2) ./openwrt_11s/scripts/fetch.sh
	3) ./openwrt_11s/scripts/configure.sh
	4) ./openwrt_11s/scripts/build.sh
	5) ./openwrt_11s/scripts/build-modules.sh
	5) ./openwrt_11s/scripts/launch.sh 

== What can you do with it?

Run mesh in a box:

root@OpenWrt:/# modprobe mac80211_hwsim
root@OpenWrt:/# iw phy0 interface add mesh0 type mesh
root@OpenWrt:/# iw phy1 interface add mesh1 type mesh
root@OpenWrt:/# ifconfig mesh0 up
root@OpenWrt:/# ifconfig mesh1 up
root@OpenWrt:/# iw mesh0 mesh join moo
root@OpenWrt:/# iw mesh1 mesh join moo
root@OpenWrt:/# iw mesh0 station dump

== How to improve it?

1. File issues
2. Fix issues

== How to fix issues?

=== Add missing packages.  

Try to find out if it's a base package (i.e. included in openwrt) or a package
from feeds.  If it is a base package:

# cd openwrt
# make menuconfig
(look for the package or search with '/')
enable
# cd ..
# ./scripts/save-configs.sh
# git commit -a -m 'Added package xyz'

If it is not a base package you will have to first 

cd openwrt
./scritps/feed install foobar

And only after that step it will appear in openwrt's menuconfig.
If you add a package from feeds, edit ./scripts/configure.sh to install it.
For instance:

# we need this to mount our development host drive on guest
./scripts/feeds install sshfs

=== Change kernel configuration options

To make a long story short, you will need to make two changes:

1. the config_files/kernel.dot.config

AND

2. the ./scripts/configure.sh (see how we enable CONFIG_AVERAGE as an example)

=== Add files to the rootfs of the target

Save them to the config_files directory and move them over the the
openwrt/files directory with ./scripts/configure.sh
